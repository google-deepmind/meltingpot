## About

Melting Pot assesses generalization to novel social situations involving both
familiar and unfamiliar individuals, and has been designed to test a broad range
of social interactions such as: cooperation, competition, deception,
reciprocation, trust, stubbornness and so on. Melting Pot offers researchers a
set of over 50 multi-agent reinforcement learning _substrates_ (multi-agent
games) on which to train agents, and over 256 unique test _scenarios_ on which
to evaluate these trained agents. The performance of agents on these held-out
test scenarios quantifies whether agents:

*   perform well across a range of social situations where individuals are
    interdependent,
*   interact effectively with unfamiliar individuals not seen during training

The resulting score can then be used to rank different multi-agent RL algorithms
by their ability to generalize to novel social situations.

We hope Melting Pot will become a standard benchmark for multi-agent
reinforcement learning. We plan to maintain it, and will be extending it in the
coming years to cover more social interactions and generalization scenarios.

If you are interested in extending Melting Pot, please refer to the
[Extending Melting Pot](docs/extending.md) documentation.

## Installation

Melting Pot is built on top of
[DeepMind Lab2D](https://github.com/deepmind/lab2d).

### Devcontainer (x86 only)

*NOTE: This Devcontainer only works for x86 platforms. For arm64 (newer M1 Macs) users will have to follow the manual installation steps.*

This project includes a pre-configured development environment ([devcontainer](https://containers.dev)).

You can launch a working development environment with one click, using e.g. [Github
Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) or the [VSCode
Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers-tutorial)
extension.

#### CUDA support

To enable CUDA support (required for GPU training), make sure you have the
[nvidia-container-toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html)
package installed, and then run Docker with the `---gpus all` flag enabled. Note
that for GitHub Codespaces this isn't necessary, as it's done for you
automatically.

### Manual install

The installation steps are as follows:

1.  (Optional) Activate a virtual environment, e.g.:

    ```shell
    python3 -m venv "${HOME}/meltingpot_venv"
    source "${HOME}/meltingpot_venv/bin/activate"
    ```

2.  Install `dmlab2d` from the
    [dmlab2d wheel files](https://github.com/deepmind/lab2d/releases/tag/release_candidate_2023-06_01), e.g.:

    ```shell
    pip3 install https://github.com/deepmind/lab2d/releases/download/release_candidate_2023-06_01/dmlab2d-1.0-cp39-cp39-manylinux_2_35_x86_64.whl
    ```

    If there is no appropriate wheel you will need to install
    [`dmlab2d`](https://github.com/deepmind/lab2d) and build the wheel
    yourself (see
    [`install-dmlab2d.sh`](https://github.com/deepmind/meltingpot/blob/main/install-dmlab2d.sh)
    for an example installation script that can be adapted to your setup).

3.  Test the `dmlab2d` installation in `python3`:

    ```python
    import dmlab2d
    import dmlab2d.runfiles_helper

    lab = dmlab2d.Lab2d(dmlab2d.runfiles_helper.find(), {"levelName": "chase_eat"})
    env = dmlab2d.Environment(lab, ["WORLD.RGB"])
    env.step({})
    ```

4.  Install Melting Pot (see
    [`install-meltingpot.sh`](https://github.com/deepmind/meltingpot/blob/main/install-meltingpot.sh)
    for an example installation script):

    ```shell
    git clone -b main https://github.com/deepmind/meltingpot
    cd meltingpot
    curl -L https://storage.googleapis.com/dm-meltingpot/meltingpot-assets-1.0.0.tar.gz \
        | tar -xz --directory=meltingpot
    pip3 install .
    ```

5.  Test the Melting Pot installation:

    ```shell
    pip3 install pytest
    pytest meltingpot
    ```

6.  (Optional) Install the examples (see
    [`install-extras.sh`](https://github.com/deepmind/meltingpot/blob/main/install-meltingpot.sh)
    for an example installation script):

    ```shell
    pip install .[rllib,pettingzoo]
    ```

## Example usage

You can try out the substrates interactively with the
[human_players](meltingpot/python/human_players) scripts. For example, to play the
`clean_up` substrate, you can run:

```shell
python3 meltingpot/python/human_players/play_clean_up.py
```

You can move around with the `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` keys, Turn with `Q`, and `E`,
fire the zapper with `1`, and fire the cleaning beam with `2`. You can switch
between players with `TAB`. There are other substrates available in the
[human_players](meltingpot/python/human_players) directory. Some have multiple variants,
which you select with the `--level_name` flag.

NOTE: If you get a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'meltingpot.python'`
      error, you can solve it by exporting the meltingpot home directory as
      `PYTHONPATH` (e.g. by calling `export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)`).

### Training agents
We provide two example scripts using RLlib and [PettingZoo](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/PettingZoo) with [Stable-Baselines3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3) (SB3) respectively. Note that Melting Pot is agnostic to how you train your agents, and as such, these scripts are not meant to be a suggestion on how to achieve good scores in the task suite.

#### RLlib
This example uses [RLLib](https://github.com/ray-project/ray) to train agents in self-play on a Melting Pot substrate.

First you will need to install the dependencies needed by the RLlib example:

```shell
cd <meltingpot_root>
pip3 install -e .[rllib]
```

Then you can run the training experiment using:

```shell
cd <meltingpot_root>/examples/rllib
python3 self_play_train.py
```

#### PettingZoo and Stable-Baselines3
This example uses a PettingZoo wrapper with a fully parameter shared PPO agent from SB3.

The PettingZoo wrapper can be used separately from SB3 and
can be found [here](examples/pettingzoo/utils.py).

```shell
cd <meltingpot_root>
pip3 install -e .[pettingzoo]
```

```shell
cd <meltingpot_root>/examples/pettingzoo
python3 sb3_train.py
```
